# SDL Memory GAME
A memory game where a player predicts a ball's path on a grid with diagonals that alter its trajectory. The player must remember the orientation of the diagonals before the machine erases them. The game is coded in C using the SDL library and includes features like menu, multiple levels, scoring, and modes for both player and machine gameplay.
